I created a landing page for an eco-cosmetics store, using the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology to organize my code. This approach helped me structure CSS classes, making the project easier to maintain and scale. I also utilized mixins for responsive design, ensuring that the page displays correctly on various devices and screen sizes. The project includes interactive elements, such as a navigation menu, contact forms, and buttons for seamless section navigation, all aimed at enhancing the overall user experience.
